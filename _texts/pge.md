"The Platonic system articulated how Promethean ‘Big Men’ could go about denting
the universe, waging wars and building cities by channeling their will through
architectural middle management, which would calcify the volatile gift of invention
into regular victories and stable institutions. I call it the Promethean Gift Economy
(PGE). It is a cipher for decoding [Venkatesh] Rao’s relevance to architecture."
